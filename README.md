crash-clone
===========

This is a clone of Crash, a game by Digital Nightmares, that itself was a clone of TRON.

The platforms I want to support are PC (Linux) and the Open Pandora.


This clone is still work in progress.
Some features of the original game are not implemented yet.

To get an idea, what the original looked like you can watch following video:

The following features are still missing:
- sound
- different AI-Levels (there is a point in the menu as a placeholder already)
(- level-size-independant framerate (well on my PC it is, but on the pandora ...))
